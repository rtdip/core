This repository contains Real Time Data Ingestion Platform SDK functions and documentation. This README will be a developer guide to understand the repository.

## What is RTDIP SDK?

​​**Real Time Data Ingestion Platform (RTDIP) SDK** is a python software development kit built to provide users, data scientists and developers with the ability to interact with components of the Real Time Data Ingestion Platform, including:

- Building, Executing and Deploying Ingestion Pipelines
- Execution of queries on RTDIP data
- Authentication to securely interact with environments and data

See [RTDIP Documentation](https://www.rtdip.io/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

# Developer Guide

## Getting Started 

1) To get started with developing for this project, clone the repository. 
```
    git clone https://github.com/rtdip/core.git
```
2) Open the respository in VS Code, Visual Studio or your preferered code editor.

3) Create a new environment using the following command:
