# Query Databricks SQL using the RTDIP SDK

This article provides a guide on how to use RTDIP SDK to query data via Databricks SQL. Before getting started, ensure you have installed the [RTDIP Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/rtdip-sdk/) and check the [RTDIP Installation Page](../../../getting-started/installation.md) for all the required prerequisites.


## How to use RTDIP SDK with Databricks SQL

The RTDIP SDK has rich support of querying data using Databricks SQL, such as allowing the user to authenticate, connect and/or use the most commonly requested methods for manipulating time series data accessible via Databricks SQL.

### Authentication

=== "Azure Active Directory"

    Refer to the [Azure Active Directory](../../authentication/azure.md) documentation for further options to perform Azure AD authentication, such as Service Principal authentication using certificates or secrets. Below is an example of performing default authentication that retrieves a token for Azure Databricks. 

    Also refer to the [Code Reference](../../code-reference/authentication/azure.md) for further technical information.

    ```python
    from rtdip_sdk.authentication import authenticate as auth

    authentication = auth.DefaultAuth().authenticate()
    access_token = authentication.get_token("2ff814a6-3304-4ab8-85cb-cd0e6f879c1d/.default").token
    ```

    !!! note "Note"
        </b>If you are experiencing any trouble authenticating please see [Troubleshooting - Authentication](troubleshooting.md)<br />

=== "Databricks"

    Refer to the [Databricks](../../authentication/databricks.md) documentation for further information about generating a Databricks PAT Token. Below is an example of performing default authentication that retrieves a token for a Databricks Workspace. 

    Provide your `dbapi.....` token to the `access_token` in the examples below.

    ```python
    access_token = "dbapi.........."
    ```

### Connect to Databricks SQL

The RTDIP SDK offers several ways to connect to a Databricks SQL Warehouse.

=== "Databricks SQL Connector"

    The simplest method to connect to RTDIP and does not require any additional installation steps.

    ```python
    from rtdip_sdk.connectors import DatabricksSQLConnection

    server_hostname = "server_hostname"
    http_path = "http_path"
    access_token = "token"

    connection = DatabricksSQLConnection(server_hostname, http_path, access_token)
    ```

    Replace **server_hostname**, **http_path** and **access_token** with your own information.

    For more information about each of the connection methods, please see [Code Reference](../../code-reference/query/db-sql-connector.md) and navigate to the required section.

=== "PYODBC"

    A popular library that python developers use for ODBC connectivity but requires more setup steps.

    [ODBC](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) or [JDBC](https://databricks.com/spark/jdbc-drivers-download) are required to leverage PYODBC. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html) to install the drivers in your environment.

    * Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it from [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

    * Driver paths can be found on [PYODBC Driver Paths](../../code-reference/query/pyodbc-sql-connector.md)

    ```python
    from rtdip_sdk.connectors import PYODBCSQLConnection

    server_hostname = "server_hostname"
    http_path = "http_path"
    access_token = "token"
    driver_path = "/Library/simba/spark/lib/libsparkodbc_sbu.dylib"

    connection = PYODBCSQLConnection(driver_path, sever_hostname, http_path, access_token)
    ```

    Replace **server_hostname**, **http_path** and **access_token** with your own information.

    For more information about each of the connection methods, please see [Code Reference](../../code-reference/query/pyodbc-sql-connector.md) and navigate to the required section.

=== "TURBODBC"
    The RTDIP development team have found this to be the most performant method of connecting to RTDIP leveraging the arrow implementation within Turbodbc to obtain data, but requires a number of additional installation steps to get working on OSX, Linux and Windows

    * [ODBC](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) or [JDBC](https://databricks.com/spark/jdbc-drivers-download) are required to leverage TURBODBC. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html) to install the drivers in your environment.
    * [Boost](https://turbodbc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/getting_started.html) needs to be installed locally to use the [TURBODBC SQL Connector](../../code-reference/query/turbodbc-sql-connector.md) (<em>Optional</em>)

    ```python
    from rtdip_sdk.connectors import TURBODBCSQLConnection

    server_hostname = "server_hostname"
    http_path = "http_path"
    access_token = "token"

    connection = TURBODBCSQLConnection(server_hostname, http_path, access_token)
    ```

    Replace **server_hostname**, **http_path** and **access_token** with your own information.

    For more information about each of the connection methods, please see [Code Reference](../../code-reference/query/turbodbc-sql-connector.md) and navigate to the required section.
    

### Functions

Finally, after authenticating and connecting using one of the methods above, you have access to the commonly requested RTDIP functions such as **Resample**, **Interpolate**, **Raw**, **Time Weighted Averages** or **Metadata**. 

1\. To use any of the RTDIP functions, use the commands below.

```python
from rtdip_sdk.queries import resample
from rtdip_sdk.queries import interpolate
from rtdip_sdk.queries import raw
from rtdip_sdk.queries import time_weighted_average
from rtdip_sdk.queries import metadata
```

2\. From functions you can use any of the following methods.

#### Resample
    resample.get(connection, parameters_dict)

#### Interpolate
    interpolate.get(connection, parameters_dict)

#### Raw
    raw.get(connection, parameters_dict)

#### Time Weighted Average
    time_weighted_average.get(connection, parameter_dict)

#### Metadata
    metadata.get(connection, parameter_dict)

For more information about the function parameters see [Code Reference](../../code-reference/query/resample.md) and navigate through the required function.

### Example

This is a code example of the RTDIP SDK Interpolate function. You will need to replace the parameters with your own requirements and details. If you are unsure on the options please see [Code Reference - Interpolate](../../code-reference/query/interpolate.md) and navigate to the attributes section. 

```python
from rtdip_sdk.authentication import authenticate as auth
from rtdip_sdk.connectors import DatabricksSQLConnection
from rtdip_sdk.queries import interpolate

authentication = auth.DefaultAuth().authenticate()
access_token = authentication.get_token("2ff814a6-3304-4ab8-85cb-cd0e6f879c1d/.default").token
connection = DatabricksSQLConnection("{server_hostname}", "{http_path}", access_token)

parameters = {
    "business_unit": "{business_unit}", 
    "region": "{region}",
    "asset": "{asset}", 
    "data_security_level": "{date_security_level}",
    "data_type": "{data_type}", #options are float, integer, string and double (the majority of data is float)
    "tag_names": ["{tag_name_1}, {tag_name_2}"],
    "start_date": "2022-03-08", #start_date can be a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or a datetime in the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"
    "end_date": "2022-03-10", #end_date can be a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or a datetime in the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"
    "time_interval_rate": "1", #numeric input
    "time_interval_unit": "hour", #options are second, minute, day or hour
    "agg_method": "first", #options are first, last, avg, min, max
    "interpolation_method": "forward_fill", #options are forward_fill, backward_fill or linear
    "include_bad_data": True #boolean options are True or False
}

result = interpolate.get(connection, parameters)
print(result)
```
