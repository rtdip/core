# Connectors

RTDIP SDK provides functionality to connect to and query its data using connectors. Below is a list of the available connectors.

## ODBC

### Databricks SQL Connector

Enables connectivity to Databricks using the [Databricks SQL Connector](https://pypi.org/project/databricks-sql-connector/) which does not require any ODBC installation. 

For more information refer to this [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/python-sql-connector.html) and for the specific implementation within the RTDIP SDK, refer to this [link](../code-reference/query/db-sql-connector.md)

```python
from rtdip_sdk.connectors import DatabricksSQLConnection

server_hostname = "server_hostname"
http_path = "http_path"
access_token = "token"

connection = DatabricksSQLConnection(server_hostname, http_path, access_token)
```

Replace **server_hostname**, **http_path** and **access_token** with your own information.

### PYODBC SQL Connector

[PYDOBC](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/) is a popular python package for querying data using ODBC. Refer to their [documentation](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki) for more information about pyodbc, how to install it and how you can leverage it in your code.

!!! Warning
    The RTDIP SDK does not specify `pyodbc` as one of its package dependencies. It will need to be installed into your environment separately.

View information about how pyodbc is implemented in the RTDIP SDK [here.](../code-reference/query/pyodbc-sql-connector.md)

```python
from rtdip_sdk.connectors import PYODBCSQLConnection

server_hostname = "server_hostname"
http_path = "http_path"
access_token = "token"
driver_path = "/Library/simba/spark/lib/libsparkodbc_sbu.dylib"

connection = PYODBCSQLConnection(driver_path, sever_hostname, http_path, access_token)
```

Replace **server_hostname**, **http_path** and **access_token** with your own information.

### TURBODBC SQL Connector 

Turbodbc is a powerful python ODBC package that has advanced options for querying performance. Find out more about installing it on your operation system and what Turbodbc can do [here](https://turbodbc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and refer to this [documentation](../code-reference/query/turbodbc-sql-connector.md) for more information about how it is implemented in the RTDIP SDK.

!!! Warning
    The RTDIP SDK does not specify `turbodbc` as one of its package dependencies. It will need to be installed into your environment separately.

```python
from rtdip_sdk.connectors import TURBODBCSQLConnection

server_hostname = "server_hostname"
http_path = "http_path"
access_token = "token"

connection = TURBODBCSQLConnection(server_hostname, http_path, access_token)
```

Replace **server_hostname**, **http_path** and **access_token** with your own information.

## Spark 

### Spark Connector 

The Spark Connector enables querying of data using a Spark Session. This is useful for querying local instances of Spark or Delta. However, the most useful application of this connector is to leverage [Spark Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html) to enable connecting to a remote Spark Cluster to provide the compute for the query being run from a local machine.

```python
from rtdip_sdk.connectors import SparkConnection

spark_server = "spark_server"
access_token = "my_token"

spark_remote = "sc://{}:443;token={}".format(spark_server, access_token)
connection = SparkConnection(spark_remote=spark_remote)
```

Replace the **access_token** with your own information.

## LLMs 

### Chat Open AI Databricks Connector

The Chat Open AI Databricks Connector enables querying of Databricks data using Chat GPT. 

!!! Warning
    This is experimental and you will likely experience variable responses to your questions depending on the complexity of the data you use in this setup. Start small, with only a 2 - 3 tables before scaling up.

```python
from rtdip_sdk.connectors import ChatOpenAIDatabricksConnection

agent = ChatOpenAIDatabricksConnection(
    catalog="<databricks catalog>", 
    schema="<databricks schema>", 
    server_hostname="<databricks host name>",                   
    http_path="<databricks http path>",                         
    access_token="<Azure AD token or databricks PAT token>",
    openai_api_key="<Open AI API key>",
    openai_model = "gpt-4",                                     
    sample_rows_in_table_info = 5, 
    verbose_logging = True
)

response = agent.run("What was the average actual power generated by Turbine 1 at ACME Wind Farm on 6 May?")
print(response)
```

Some notes on the above:

- `server_hostname` and `http_path` can be obtained from your [Databricks SQL Warehouse](../../sdk/queries/databricks/sql-warehouses.md) or Databricks Cluster.
- `access_token` can be either a Databricks PAT Token or Azure AD Token. To obtain an Azure AD token, please refer to this [documentation](../../sdk/authentication/azure.md)
- `open_ai_model` defaults to `gpt-4` but is not easily available at the time of writing. Alternatively, the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613` has worked well in our tests
- `sample_rows_in_table_info` limits the number of rows queried in a table when the SQL Database Agent is looking context in the data. Be careful to not increase this too much as its then possible to exceed token limits on the gpt models
