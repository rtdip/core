# RTDIP REST APIs

RTDIP provides REST API endpoints for querying data in the platform. The APIs are a wrapper to the python [RTDIP SDK](../sdk/overview.md) and provide similar functionality for users and applications that are unable to leverage the python RTDIP SDK. It is recommended to read the [RTDIP SDK documentation](../sdk/overview.md) and in particular the [Functions](../sdk/code-reference/query/resample.md) section for more information about the options and logic behind each API.
