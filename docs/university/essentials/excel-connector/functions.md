# Exercise: Exploring the Functions

As you will have seen in the previous execise, the Excel Add-in gets data from the RTDIP API with custom functions. In fact, each api route has it's own custom function in Excel.

**Try these exercises to get familiar with the functions:**

1. Write a function directly by referencing parameter values to cells. First, place your parameters in cells (e.g. In cell `B2` put your tagname). Then, in the cell where you want your data, write `=RTDIP.` and you will see the various functions available. Excel will hint which parameters go where.
2. Refactor a formula in your sheet from a previous exercise and change the inputs to reference cells.

A function may look like: 
`=RTDIP.RAW("apiUrl", "region", etc...)`

**Optional:**

1. Try removing optional parameters. These are shown with square brackets around them, for example `[includeBadData]`. If not input, the defaults will be input behind the scenes.
