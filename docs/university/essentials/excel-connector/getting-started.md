To get started, open up Microsoft Excel and go to the `Home` tab. On the right you should see the RTDIP Taskpane like this (if not, you may need to click `Add-ins`):

<center> ![Excel](assets/home-tab.png){width=200px} </center>


Once opened, the set-up screen will show and will ask for your API URL. This will be the same URL as in the previous lessons in the format `https://YOUR_ORGANISATION_DOMAIN/api/v1`

After this, you should see our friendly taskpane (you are now completely set-up and ready to make some queries!):
<center> ![Excel](assets/taskpane.png){width=40%} </center>
