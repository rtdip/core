def get(connection: object, parameters_dict: dict) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    An RTDIP interpolation at time function which works out the linear interpolation at a specific time based on the points before and after.

    This function requires the user to input a dictionary of parameters. (See Attributes table below.)

    Args:
        connection: Connection chosen by the user (Databricks SQL Connect, PYODBC SQL Connect, TURBODBC SQL Connect)
        parameters_dict: A dictionary of parameters (see Attributes table below)

    Attributes:
        business_unit (str): Business unit of the data
        region (str): Region
        asset (str):  Asset
        data_security_level (str): Level of data security
        data_type (str): Type of the data (float, integer, double, string)
        tag_names (str): Name of the tag
        timestamps (list): List of timestamp or timestamps in the format YYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS or YYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+zz:zz where %z is the timezone. (Example +00:00 is the UTC timezone)
        window_length (int): Add longer window time in days for the start or end of specified date to cater for edge cases.
        include_bad_data (bool): Include "Bad" data points with True or remove "Bad" data points with False
        pivot (bool): Pivot the data on timestamp column with True or do not pivot the data with False
        limit (optional int): The number of rows to be returned
        offset (optional int): The number of rows to skip before returning rows
    Returns:
        DataFrame: A interpolated at time dataframe.
